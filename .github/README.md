# Multiple specializations
## Description
This module allows the learning of all profession specializations at once, including the abilty to learn all recipes associated with them.

## How to use ingame
The sql queery and scripts required to make all this work should automatically load on the first server boot after rebuilding your server.
In the case of leatherworking you need to retalk to the npc after completing the quest that unlocks the specilization and use a chat option, in the case of armor/weapon smithing you will get a quest telling you to talk to a nearby npc to do the same.
